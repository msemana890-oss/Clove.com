<h2> Yang Jian has a third eye hidden within his forehead, which is why Nuwa chose him as her successor and
<br> bestowed upon him the role of protector of the mortal world. However, after hunting wrongdoers and
<br> patrolling the realm for a long time, he began to have doubts about Nuwa's motives. After he had fought
<br> in one war after the next and seen a succession of ruler's wrestle control from each other, the trials of his
<br> friend Nezha finally made him realize that perhaps the world wasn't quite as fragile as Nuwa would have
<br> it. The creatures that inhabited it had their own will and lives, and in time, he decided to fight for their
<br> right to rule over themselves.
</h2>

<h3> <ins> Lore </ins> </h3>

<h4> The young Yang Jian had a secret, a secret that nobody knew about. A "third eye" was hidden within his
<br> forehead. Though the eye couldn't be seen from the outside, the power it contained could always be felt.
<br> No one could tell him what it was, but he was certain that he was different from regular humans, which
<br> made him very careful to stay away from others. People envied the boy’s good luck, commented on his
<br> indifference and arrogance, and praised his elegance and strength behind his back. But in the warm
<br> sunset, he looked at the carefree human children with envy and watched as the hot-tempered and
<br> stubborn Nezha got into fights with others. During this time, only the stray puppies he picked up became
<br> his companions.
<br> 
<br> Like many of those born to nobility, he was sent to Celestia to study sorcery when he was very young. He	
<br> stood out as a rare genius and was finally chosen by Nuwa to be her successor.
<br> 
<br> "You are my heir. One day, this world will be handed over to you to protect." The majestic mentor Nuwa	
<br> pointed to an incredibly exquisite mechanism and said to the young boy, "You will be the incarnation of
<br> the will to protect this world." The mechanism before him was the core of a superbeing object called the
<br> "Ark." The soil beneath where it had landed was named the Original Lands.
<br> 
<br> "You must work harder than me to protect this world! If you don't... you will allow tragedy to happen
<br> again..."
<br> 
<br> The harsh words echoed in the boy's heart for a long time. The power in his "third eye" surged.
<br> 
<br> Outside of the glorious Original Lands, the Feralis rebelled from time to time. The boy gradually grew into
<br> a young man and was ordered to patrol the land to hunt Feralis. His ingenuity and sorcery were
<br> unmatched. Though hunting hardened his heart, the invisible eye on his forehead constantly reminded
<br> him of the question: "Who am I?"
<br> 
<br> Knowing the answer before the Enforcers' War broke out, Nuwa gave him a top-secret mission. "Your
<br> loyalty is impressive, but to prove yourself you must accept a final trial." As it turned out, the task was to
<br> kill the Sanctifier, Jiang Ziya, at the last moment of the war. Nuwa's control of the world was slipping from
<br> her. If King Zhou was to fall, she did not want to see another independent monarch come into power,
<br> regardless of whether he supported Feralis or Humans. Thus, it was necessary to eliminate any such
<br> potential threats.
<br> 
<br> "Use your 'eye' and what you learned in the Original Lands to protect the world in my place," Nuwa
<br> stressed.
<br> 
<br> Primaera was in the process of deviating from the right track and gradually collapsing in its struggle. But
<br> this was her world! The civilization she had worked so hard to recreate!
<br> 
<br> Nuwa, whose strength was declining by the day, was uncertain of her victory over the paranoid and
<br> tyrannical Jiang Ziya. The only one she could trust now was Yang Jian.
<br> 
<br> Yang Jian had no choice but to join Jiang Ziya's army. The completely transformed "eye," as the symbol of
<br> the superbeings, was no longer hidden. That power was bubbling under the surface, making him stronger.
<br> 
<br> But something unexpected happened—the reunion with the aggressive Nezha. As always, his inflexible	
<br> perseverance was a headache, though his reckless strength on the battlefield inspired the whole camp.
<br> After going through a complete transformation, Nezha had become strong enough to make the young
<br> man consider if he needed to eliminate Nezha in advance if he was to carry out his mission smoothly.
<br> 
<br> During an inspection of the Muye Wastelands before a battle, the two were ambushed by King Zhou's
<br> army. At the moment of victory, they were both exhausted, and Yang Jian saw an opportunity. However,
<br> just as he was about to shoot, Nezha sped forward and blocked what would have been a fatal blow to
<br> Yang Jian. The injured Nezha looked at the defensive line in the distance as if nothing had happened, and
<br> said cheerfully: "The battle starts tomorrow. I'll take care of everything here! None of them will take a
<br> single step beyond this line."
<br> 
<br> Yang Jian suddenly remembered Nezha's coastal hometown had been submerged under crushing tidal
<br> waves. It is said that to carry out the orders of those in power and completely eliminate the Feralis from
<br> the sea, the people set up an ambush at the cost of flooding the entire city. Are the actions of those in
<br> power really "protecting" this world? Is Nuwa's aim really to "protect," or could it be that she is just
<br> obsessively clinging to outdated ideals?
<br> 
<br> The world may not be as weak as Nuwa thought. It is beautiful, extraordinary, and full of life. Even if it is
<br> damaged beyond recognition by the fires of war, it will recover in the spring of the following year.
<br> Primaera is a brand new world, a brand new land. It has its own society, its own humans, its own will and
<br> life. It's not a substitute for some other, long-lost planet.
<br> 
<br> "Hey, wanna cause some trouble?" Nezha turned his head and asked.
<br> 
<br> Yang Jian nodded, though he did not mean to.
<br> 
<br> What will tomorrow be like?
<br> 
<br> Yang Jian and his companion continued patrolling the defensive line. But his long cold blood had slowly
<br> started to burn.
<br> 
<br> "I was called upon to protect this mortal world!"
