<h1> <ins> Background </ins> </h1>

<h2> Xuance's life has been defined by two abandonments, and he's tired of it. He was abandoned by his
<br> brother when a sudden attack forced Shouyue to depart for the community's forward posts. And then by
<br> his mentor and commander, Prince of Lanling. Though this could be charitably interpreted as an
<br> opportunity for him to reunite with his brother. Xuance's long association with Prince of Lanling provided
<br> him with invaluable training in subterfuge, weapon use, and assassination. Years of dirty work have
<br> developed a hard edge to the once innocent young man, but strangely has not removed that sense of
<br> innocence entirely. However, it has reaffirmed Xuance's conviction that a life lived without others is
<br> happy and sufficient... except for his older brother.
</h2>

<h3> <ins> Lore </ins> </h3>

<h4> Xuance would never forget that day, the day a hoard of brigands attacked their border town. The Great
<br> Wall Guard and the townspeople did their best to defend the city gates. The brigands who were trapped
<br> inside the town took the elderly and the weak as hostages to make their escape.
<br> 
<br> A moment of utter terror. Yet the cries of the townsfolk broke the young man's heart. He climbed out of
<br> the water tank in which he was hiding and ran over to help.
<br> 
<br> He doesn't remember much after that, only that the bad guys weren't your average brigands, and that
<br> they all ended up dying at the hand of their leader. His older brother never came to his aid, no one did.
<br> Xuance was chosen by the leader to be sacrificed in order to awaken something powerful. Amid the
<br> fleeing crowd and chaos, desperate and fearful, Xuance watched in horror as a nameless swordsman was
<br> engulfed in an evil mist in his stead.
<br> 
<br> Once everything fell quiet, and the full moon silently illuminated the vast desert, the man took him away.
<br> 
<br> From that day on, Xuance took Prince of Lanling as his master, and they lived by the nearly dried-up
<br> Mooneye Sea. After years of brutal training, Xuance grew into a skilled nightwalker with a sickle as his
<br> only companion.
<br> 
<br> The Prince of Lanling lived in seclusion, gathering intel from his former subordinates, and disappearing
<br> and returning from time to time. He didn't trust a soul, and always acted alone. In his signature style, the
<br> little madman was accustomed to stirring up trouble all by himself as he wandered the desert.
<br> 
<br> The survivors of the disaster had been scattered across the desert, struggling to survive in the harsh
<br> elements and under the constant threat of the feralis. But wherever people gather, oppression and strife
<br> will always follow.
<br> 
<br> The little madman was the nemesis of injustice. At first, he only challenged feralis stronger than himself,
<br> but quickly he learned how to shuttle back and forth between different oases in the desert, harassing and
<br> combating any who might use their power to toy with the fates of others: crooked brigands, tyrannical
<br> nomad leaders, hustlers traveling the Silk Road, and plain old scoundrels in search of power. This mad
<br> pleasure was a means of catharsis for his pain, allowing him to exact revenge on those who orchestrated
<br> the trauma of his past.
<br> 
<br> Until the day he met a powerful opponent.
<br> 
<br> She was a formidable fighter whose sea heath sword bloomed on the battlefield as it crushed any ferali in
<br> her way. She was determined, and facing her felt like facing a strict parent to Xuance. Is this how the
<br> Great Wall Guards are? How could she disregard the stain on her name and slice apart Xuance's
<br> innocence?
<br> 
<br> Do you know? Your master is a ghost, a ghost who wanders the Great Wall.
<br> 
<br> Do you know? The brigands weren't the mastermind behind that tragic attack.
<br> 
<br> Do you know? Someone has never stopped searching for you.
<br> 
<br> How many times had he gazed at the Great Wall under the moonlight? The moonlight illuminates the long
<br> road home. I absolutely hate you, but I miss you too, brother. Are you on the other side of the moonlit
<br> path, staring at me in the desert and remembering our unfulfilled promise?
<br> 
<br> Xuance brought the enemy Mulan to his master. As they faced each other, he realized that this was not
<br> the first time they had met. It would appear that after countless battles in the dark of night, Mulan had
<br> finally chosen to make a move. She aimed to persuade the stubborn Prince of Lanling to uncover the
<br> person behind the attack.
<br> 
<br> "Xuance, do you want to go back?" his master asked. "Then go back with her. But we'll see if you don't
<br> come running back here, crying."
<br> 
<br> A frightening storm rose in the desert.
<br> 
<br> The raging chain hook kicked up sand and stones that carried the young man's rage. He didn't know how
<br> to express his feelings, and he didn't know if he could take the pain of being abandoned again.
<br> 
<br> The roaring in his heart turned into a fluid sickle, but his attacks didn't land... When the Prince of Lanling
<br> reappeared, his blade was already at Xuance's throat.
<br> 
<br> "A lacking disciple."
<br> 
<br> "Do you finally admit that you're my master?" The young man shouted.
<br> 
<br> "No, I don't need disciples or companions."
<br> 
<br> The masked man sighed as he let go.
<br> 
<br> The madness faded from the young man's bloodshot eyes as the chain hook dropped to the ground.He
<br> watched as the figure who had raised him strictly disappeared into the wind and sand, looking like he
<br> would not come back again.
<br> 
<br> "Do I bring bad luck? Everyone abandons me eventually," Xuance muttered to himself.
<br> 
<br> "He didn't abandon you. He just chose to face his fears alone," Mulan said tenderly. She knew very well
<br> that a terrible fear lay hidden deep within the sandstorm.
<br> 
<br> "Aren't you guys enemies?! How dare you tell me what my master is thinking!"
<br> 
<br> "It's probably because we all have our own hometowns to protect."
<br> 
<br> "I'm here to steal the show!"
